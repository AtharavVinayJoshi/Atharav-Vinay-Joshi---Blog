        <h3>Atharav Vinay Joshi – Founder</h3>
        <p>
          Dr. Vinay S. Consultancy was founded with a vision to bring meaningful, personalized guidance to those seeking clarity in life, career, and relationships.
          I created this platform to expand and modernize the legacy of Dr. Vinay S. Joshi — my father, mentor, and now partner — whose expertise in astrology,
          psychology, and corporate strategy has transformed countless lives. Together, we blend traditional wisdom with real-world insight to guide people toward
          lasting success and inner balance.

        <h3>Dr. Vinay S. Joshi – Co-Founder</h3>
        <p>
          With over 30 years of experience in the corporate world, combined with my lifelong practice in astrology and psychology, I’ve come to understand the deep
          connections between mindset, timing, and decision-making. Atharav’s foresight and passion gave my work a new platform — turning a personal mission into a
          dynamic consultancy. His vision helped shape our approach: honest, insightful, and deeply human. Today, we stand united in helping others find clarity,
          direction, and confidence.
